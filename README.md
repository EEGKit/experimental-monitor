# Experimental Monitor

---

Repository of the current version (as of 2018) of the code necessary to run on the Experimental Monitor device I built. It also includes the code used to communicate with it on MATLAB (although any software that communicate through the serial port (over USB) will work).

---

The full git history is not included, because it seemed like more effort than it was worth to sanitize my personal email across all of the branches as well rebasing to include the license from the beginning.
